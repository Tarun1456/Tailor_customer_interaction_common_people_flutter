Tailor Connect is an innovative platform redefining the conventional tailoring experience by seamlessly connecting tailors and customers through a user-centric mobile application. Serving as a centralized hub, Tailor Connect allows tailors and customers to create accounts, establishing a streamlined interaction process within their local communities. The primary goal of Tailor Connect is to simplify access and communication between tailors and potential customers, thereby enhancing convenience and efficiency throughout the garment creation journey.
For customers, the application provides a user-friendly interface enabling them to browse and access a comprehensive directory of registered tailors nearby. This feature empowers customers to evaluate tailor profiles, review expertise, and make informed decisions based on personal preferences and tailor portfolios. This level of insight grants customers greater control and confidence in selecting tailors aligned with their specific garment needs.






1.4	Problem Statement


Problem Statement (Tailor's Perspective):
Tailors face challenges in reaching a wider audience and expanding their customer base due to the absence of a digital presence. This limitation confines them to a local customer base, resulting in missed growth opportunities. These communication gaps can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and decreased customer satisfaction.

Problem Statement (Customer’s Perspective):
Customers visiting tailor shops face difficulties when comparing prices and designs, as well as finding tailors who can deliver garments within a shorter timeframe. To address these issues, there is a need for a tailored customer interaction app that provides a platform for efficient price and design comparisons, and connects customers with tailors.



1.5	Objectives


1.	Expand Tailor's Reach: The first objective is to help tailors expand their reach beyond their local customer base.
2.	Address Customer Challenges: The second objective is to address the challenges that customers face when comparing prices, designs, and finding tailors with quick turnaround times.
3.	Locate Nearby Tailors: As an additional feature, the app can include an option to find nearby tailors. This objective is focused on providing convenience to customers and allowing them to choose between online and offline measurement options.
4.	Tailor Profiles: Provide tailors with the capability to create and maintain profiles on the app. Tailors can showcase their work, display their designs, specify their pricing, and highlight their experience and expertise. This adds a personal touch and helps build trust with potential customers.

1.6	Scope

•	Local Focus: The app primarily targets a specific locality or region, ensuring that tailors and customers can connect within their immediate vicinity. Language
•	Limitations: The app will be available exclusively in English, simplifying communication for users
